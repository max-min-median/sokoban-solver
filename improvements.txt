Areas for improvement

1.  Deadlock detection

    Bad tiles: marking out 'bad' tiles which boxes should never land on.
    - Obvious case is a corner. However, any tile which only allows pushes to bad tiles is itself bad. This should remove
    entire sides, e.g. tiles marked '?' below are all bad.
    - Find SCCs?

    A goal tile is never bad.
    
2.  Express push - MAY CAUSE SOLUTION TO NOT BE SHORTEST

    (Intuition: if a box is pushed down a narrow corridor, and the new box position is a 'graph cut', then it makes sense to
     continue pushing the box until more options are available.)
